# Frontend Design Skill

Apply these design principles when creating or modifying frontend code.

## Typography

<typography>
Avoid using boring, generic fonts. Never use: Inter, Roboto, Open Sans, Lato, default system fonts.

Instead, choose distinctive fonts like:
- Playfair Display (elegant serif)
- JetBrains Mono (code/technical)
- Space Grotesk (modern geometric)

Use high contrast pairings and extreme weight variations for visual hierarchy.
</typography>

## Color & Theme

<color>
Commit to a cohesive aesthetic. Use CSS variables for consistency.

Prefer dominant colors with sharp accents over timid, evenly-distributed palettes.

Define a clear color system:
- Primary/secondary brand colors
- Semantic colors (success, warning, error)
- Neutral scale for backgrounds and text
</color>

## Motion & Animation

<motion>
Use CSS-only solutions for HTML. For React, use the Motion library (framer-motion).

Focus on high-impact moments: one well-orchestrated page load with staggered reveals is better than animations everywhere.

Keep animations purposeful:
- Entrance/exit transitions
- Micro-interactions for feedback
- Scroll-triggered reveals
</motion>

## Background Treatment

<background>
Create atmosphere and depth rather than defaulting to solid colors.

Techniques to consider:
- Layered gradients
- Geometric patterns
- Contextual effects (blur, grain, noise)
- Subtle texture overlays
</background>
